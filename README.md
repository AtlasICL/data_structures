# Some of my work for the module ECM1414 - Data Structures and Algorithms

---

## Data structures implemented:

| Trees                | Queues                     | Graphs           | Linked Lists                     | Stacks | Arrays        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Binary Search Tree   | Queue                      | Directed graph   | Linked list                      | Stack  | Dynamic array |
| AVL Tree             | Deque (double-ended queue) | Undirected graph | Circular linked list (/Josephus) |
| Red-black tree (WIP) |                            | Weighted graph   |                                  |        |

## Algorithms implemented 

| Arrays         | Graphs               | Trees |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| Bubble sort    | Breadth-first search | In-order traversal
| Insertion sort | Depth-first search   | Pre-order traversal
|                | Kruskal's algorithm  |
