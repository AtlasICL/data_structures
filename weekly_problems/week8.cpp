/**
 * Problem Week 8:
 * 
 * Write a program to sort an array of integers using insertion sort.
 * Print the sorted array.
 * 
 * Challenge: implement a hybrid sorting algorithm that switches from
 * merge sort to insertion sort when the subarray size falls below a
 * threshold (e.g. k=10).
 * Compare its performance with plain merge sort.
