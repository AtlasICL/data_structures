/**
 * Problem Week 10:
 * 
 * Problem: implement Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning
 * tree of a simple weighted graph.
 * 
 * Challenge: implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the 
 * shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. 
 * Test it on graphs with both positive and negative edge weights
 * (no negative cycles).
